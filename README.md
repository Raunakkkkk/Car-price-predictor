## Car Price Predictor Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting car prices using Linear Regression. The goal of this project is to build a model that estimates the selling price of a car based on various features sourced from the Quikr dataset.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the Quikr dataset for modeling.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements a linear regression algorithm to predict car prices. Includes model training and evaluation using performance metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes visualizations to explore relationships between features and model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics and visualizations to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the linear regression model.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
